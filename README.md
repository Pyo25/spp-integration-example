### What is this repository for? ###
* This repository demonstrates how to easily integrate SendCloud's Service Point Picker into a custom application.
* Currently implements SendCloud's 1.0 Service Point Picker Embed JS.

### Tips ###
* Read our [index.html](index.html) code.

### How do I get it set up? ###
* Enable Service Points in your SendCloud's API integration
* Play around with `index.html`. When selecting a service point you'll receive a Service Point object as the result. 
* You'll need that data later when creating a new parcel through our Parcels API (see __Create new parcel__ in [our api documentation](https://docs.sendcloud.sc/api/v2/index.html#parcel)). Make sure to fill in the `to_service_point` parameter when sending the data over.

### Officially supported browsers ###
* IE >= 9
* Firefox
* Chrome
